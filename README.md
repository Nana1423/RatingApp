# Rating

This project aims to create an interactive rating app. The goal is to allow users to select and submit a number rating, display a "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating, and show hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page.

## Features

- Users can select a rating: The component will present a visually appealing and intuitive UI where users can choose a rating from a predefined set (e.g., 1 to 5 stars or a numerical scale).

- Submitting a rating triggers a "Thank you" card: Once the user submits their rating, a "Thank you" card will be displayed, providing feedback and acknowledgment for their action.

- Hover and focus states: All interactive elements on the page, such as buttons and input elements, will respond to user interactions with hover and focus states. This enhances the user experience and provides visual feedback on their interactions.

## Technologies Used

1. HTML5: Used for structuring the web page and defining the interactive elements.

2. CSS: Employed to style the components and create the visual design as per the provided design.

3. JavaScript: Utilized for handling user interactions, implementing the rating submission logic, and triggering the "Thank you" card state.

4. Bootstrap: Utilized to enhance the responsiveness and visual appeal of the rating component by leveraging its CSS and JavaScript components.
